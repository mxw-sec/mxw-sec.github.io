This is the first blog on my new site, I know it isn't much yet, but I am hoping that over time this will become a resource for myself and others as I document my experiences in the DevOps World.

## Background

Lets see if this works properly
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
